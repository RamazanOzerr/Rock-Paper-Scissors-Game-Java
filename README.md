# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME JAVA
this is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game for android devices written in Java.

# GAMEPLAY
The game logic is like a card game, there are 3 different cards and 3 different card fields. A random card comes to each card field and the player chooses a card to make his/her move. 
It is also possible to have same card in all card fields 


# GAME DIFFICULTY
There are 3 game modes; easy, medium and hard.

## Easy Mode
In this mode the probability of winning is %80.
we increase the number of cards to 5 and make the extra 2 cards as the card that wont win the game, here is an example:
the player make the move as Rock, so he will lose if the opponent plays Paper, but if we add 2 more cards (we add 2 scissors in this case)
the probability of having a Paper move comes from the opponent is now %20, so now the probability of the player winning the game is %80.

## Medium Mode
In this mode the probability of winning is %50.
we decrease the number of cards to 2, we simply prevent the possibility of getting a tied game, so the probability of winning becomes %50

## Hard Mode
In this mode the probability of winning is %33.
we simply don't change anything.
